## Documentation rules

This documentation is written as part of the developement process : a matching .md file is required for each HLF (high level feature, a.k.a Epics) upon delivery to MG60 (Maturity Grade 60) 

The developement process is described in [Developement Guidelines](01_development_methods/development.md), which you should read first.
